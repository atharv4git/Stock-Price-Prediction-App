# Stock price prediction
The machine learning model could use historical stock price data to make predictions about future prices. Inputs could include historical stock price data and the desired prediction date. Outputs could include the predicted stock price for the specified date.
    
**Problem Statement**: Many investors are interested in predicting future stock prices to make informed investment decisions. However, stock prices can be influenced by a wide range of factors, making it challenging to accurately predict future prices. A stock price prediction tool could use historical data and machine learning algorithms to provide investors with predictions of future stock prices.

**Inputs**: The stock price prediction tool could accept historical stock price data (e.g. daily closing prices) and other relevant data (e.g. company financials, economic indicators). The system could also accept user-defined parameters (e.g. prediction horizon, confidence level).

**Outputs**: The stock price prediction tool could provide predictions of future stock prices based on the input data and user-defined parameters. The system could also provide measures of prediction accuracy (e.g. mean squared error) to help investors assess the reliability of the predictions
